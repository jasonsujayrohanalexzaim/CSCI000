					I was in the IB program and am certified bilingual. I was 10 years old when I first discovered my love for computers. While I was in high school, I took computer science classes and liked programming. During my studies I discovered a love for programming simple algorithms. That and my previous interest in computers pushed me toward a career in comp sci.
